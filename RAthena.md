**rAthena** is a free and open source implementation of [Aegis](/wikipedia:AEGIS_(Ragnarok_Online) "wikilink"), a [Ragnarok Online](/wikipedia:Ragnarok_Online "wikilink") game server, and is written in [C](/wikipedia:C_(programming_language) "wikilink").

Repository
----------

We currently update rAthena via [Git](https://github.com/rathena/rathena).

Support for [SVN](/Subversion "wikilink") was dropped in late 2013. The [SVN repository](http://svn.code.sf.net/p/rathena/svn/trunk/) and [Trac](http://trac.rathena.org/) are still viewable, but are no longer updated.

Support
-------

You may access our [forums](http://rathena.org/board/) or [IRC channel](/IRC "wikilink") for support. Please note that only [Linux](/wikipedia:Linux "wikilink"), [FreeBSD](/wikipedia:FreeBSD "wikilink") and [Windows](/wikipedia:Microsoft_Windows "wikilink") operating systems are officially supported.

History
-------

-   [rAthena](/rAthena "wikilink") is derived from [eAthena](/eAthena "wikilink").
-   [AppleGirl](/User:AppleGirl "wikilink") modified jA, adding 2-2 skills and other new features while translating it into English and named it Applemod.
-   AppleGirl was joined by Rovert who, together, created Athena.
-   Eventually, other developers joined and made up the [staff](/staff "wikilink") we have today.
