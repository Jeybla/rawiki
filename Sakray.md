**Sakray** is what official [Ragnarok Online](/Ragnarok_Online "wikilink") test servers are usually referred to. They are used to test new content and features, before they get installed on the normal servers. When the name "Sakray" is used alone, it typically refers to the kRO Sakray server. Sakray servers are always accessible via a separate client, which is available through a separate download.

History
-------

### Renewal

Gravity discontinued the original Sakray development after June 17, 2009, where the last Sakray client was released, and replaced it with Sakray Renewal, which is mostly referred to as "Renewal" or "RE".

The intention for renewing Ragnarok Online, was partially the decreasing interest in the game, due to it's age and lack of features present in latest MMORPG, such as tabbed chat or safe skill point distribution, which were part of the first round of renewal, the interface renewal. Further changes include an overhaul in the stat, damage and experience calculation.

Usage
-----

[Hexed](/Hexing "wikilink") kRO Sakray clients are the most used clients with [rAthena](/rAthena "wikilink"), although a few people prefer using kRO (live server) clients or clients from different service providers.
