Syntax
------

-   [useatcmd](/useatcmd "wikilink") "command";

Description
-----------

This command will execute a script-bound atcommand for the attached RID. If the supplied command is not bound to any script, this command will act like [atcommand](/atcommand "wikilink") and attempt to execute a source-defined command.

The three .@atcmd_\*\*\*\*\* variables will NOT be set when invoking script-bound atcommands in this way.
