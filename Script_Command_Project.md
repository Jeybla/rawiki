Scope
=====

This project is aimed at documenting all of the script commands that were or are available in rAthena. Past commands will be tagged with obsolete.

To-do
=====

-   Make sure all of the current script command pages follow a certain set of rules and formats.
-   Any new ones should follow the same format.
-   Document obsolete scripting commands that may have been taken out of rAthena.
-   Make a template page or coding page (maybe on this one?) that shows new users and old users what each script command page should look like. Include the headings **Syntax**, **Description**, and **Examples**

Members
=======

These members are extensively involved with this project and should be contacted for any major changes.
