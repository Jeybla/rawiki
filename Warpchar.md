Syntax
------

-   [warpchar](/warpchar "wikilink") "<mapname>",<x>,<y>,<char_id>;

Description
-----------

Warps another player to specified map and coordinate given the char id, which you can get with getcharid(0,<player_name>). Obviously this is useless if you want to warp the same player that is executing this script, unless it's some kind of "chosen" script.

Examples
--------

`warpcharÂ "prontera",123,123,150001;`
