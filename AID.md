An **account id** uniquely identifies a player (gender F and M) or server account (gender S) not only inside the database, but also in inter-server communication and in associations of data with an account, such as [account variables](/Variables "wikilink"). In-game it is mostly used as a [game id](/GID "wikilink"). It should not be confused with [character id](/CID "wikilink") which identifies a character.
