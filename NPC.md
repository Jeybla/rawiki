[thumb|[Kafra](Kafra "wikilink") NPC](Image:Kafra2.gif) [NPC](/NPC "wikilink") stands for Non-Player (or playable) Character. An NPC is any person or "living" creature in a game not controlled by a player. For example, any units in any game that would give you a quest, tell you what to do, or just stand there while you speak to them is considered an NPC.

In [Ragnarok Online](Ragnarok_Online), NPCs are a pretty big part of the game. The [rAthena](/rAthena "wikilink") scripting language is used to create NPCs. You can find many premade NPCs on the [rAthena Forums](http://rathena.org/board/). Any character you speak to in Ragnarok Online not controlled by a player is an NPC. From warpers, over healers and quest guides, to item sellers. Generally, in Ragnarok Online, a monster is referred to as a [mob](/mob "wikilink"), and not an NPC, however they are technically considered NPCs as well.
