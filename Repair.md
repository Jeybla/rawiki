Syntax
------

-   **repair** <broken item number>;

Description
-----------

This command repairs a broken piece of equipment, using the same list of broken items as available through [getbrokenid](/getbrokenid "wikilink").

The official scripts seem to use the repair command as a function instead: **repair**(<number>)' but it returns nothing on the stack. Probably only Valaris, who made it, can answer why is it so.

Examples
--------

**`repair`**`Â 1101;`

See [getbrokenid](/getbrokenid "wikilink") for a more in-depth example on usage of this command.
