[Category:Script_Command](/Category:Script_Command "wikilink")

Syntax
------

-   [changesex](/changesex "wikilink");

Description
-----------

This command will change the gender of the invoking character's account. If it was male, it will become female, if it was female, it will become male. The change will be written to the character server and the invoking character is disconnected, since there is no other way to notify the client of the gender change. When they log back in, they will be the opposite sex.

All characters will have their equipment unequipped upon gender change. If any character of the affected account was Dancer/Gypsy it will become Bard/Clown and vice versa, and get their skills reset.
