Syntax
------

-   [bg_monster](/bg_monster "wikilink")(<BG Team ID>,"<mapname>",<x>,<y>,"<name>",<mob id>{,"<event>"});

Description
-----------

This command is part of the Battleground System and works nearly the same as '[monster](/monster "wikilink")', but the spawned monster will fight for the selected BG team and '[bg_monster](/bg_monster "wikilink")' returns the GID of the spawned monster. The GID can be useful for commands like '[bg_monster_set_team](/bg_monster_set_team "wikilink")'.
