IRC?
====

[IRC](/IRC "wikilink") stands for [Internet Relay Chat](/wikipedia:Internet_Relay_Chat "wikilink"). Basically, it's chatroom server and client software in general. In [IRC](/IRC "wikilink"), you have servers and channels. Servers hold the channels, and are hosted on dedicated machines. The channels are the actual chatrooms. [IRC](/IRC "wikilink") allows you to chat with people in real-time around the world.

rAthena on IRC
==============

Note that although you may be able to receive support people in the channel, the [Staff](/Staff "wikilink") agreed that the channel is not a support channel, rather just a part of the [rAthena](/rAthena "wikilink") community. So if you really want to ask something, just put your question into the air and wait, instead of *asking whether you may ask* or if someone is currently available.

Connecting to IRC
-----------------

The official [rAthena](/rAthena "wikilink") channel room can be found [here](irc://irc.rizon.net/rathena).
Web-based IRC chat is available too: <http://go.rathena.org/irc>

To actually connect to [IRC](/IRC "wikilink"), if you do not already have an [IRC client](/wikipedia:Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients "wikilink") and do not wish to run the java chat, you're going to need an IRC client. There are many different IRC clients, and none are really the 'best'. Opinions vary on which are better. The most commonly used IRC client on [Microsoft Windows](/wikipedia:Microsoft_Windows "wikilink") is [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com). The most commonly used client on \*nix is a tossup between [BitchX](http://www.bitchx.org) and [XChat](http://www.xchat.org). Note that XChat is pay-to-use on [Windows](/wikipedia:Microsoft_Windows "wikilink"), but not on \*nix.

For those not looking to go in-depth into manuals to figure out how to connect, you can actually be up and running by simply installing mIRC, and then typing the following two commands into the mIRC command line on the status window:

` /nick NickYouWantHere`
` /server irc.rizon.net -j #rathena `

And you'll be connected.

rAthena Related Channels
------------------------

Currently there are two public rAthena IRC channels:

-   **\#rathena** - rAthena General Chat
-   **\#rathena-dev** - rAthena Developers Public Chat

\#rathena & \#rathena-dev Channel Rules
---------------------------------------

**These rules are *in addition* to the Rizon IRC Rules** (which are sent to your IRC client in the MOTD when you connect).

The IRC rules were drafted to maintain peace. Anyone, including people with ranks, are not above the rules. If one fails to comply with the rules, he/she will be banned/kick, under the discretion of the channel operators. The decision of the channel operators are final, and arguing with the operators will only bring you a longer ban period.

`1. No channel/RO server advertising in any form.`

There should be absolutely no private server advertisements of any form. An exception applies if the person is asking for support on a particular issue related to rAthena, including but not limited to Control Panel Setups/Third Party Support.
2. No color abuse (including ascii/extended ascii/color art). Abuse of colored text/ascii/extended ascii is strictly not allowed. Deliberate attempts will result in a ban. There are many other ways to emphasize your text, for example, using _underscores_.
3. No custom IRC bots are allowed. Automated scripts/bots that reply automatically to conversations or specific triggers are not allowed, with the exception of those given consent. Permitted bots include only Wat and Logbot (see below).
4. No racism/bigotry discussion are allowed. Racism of any form, whether direct or indirect, is not allowed. Links to racism-related sites are also not allowed.
5. No pornography/warez links in any form or method. Links to any objectionable website (those not suitable to be viewed by a minor) is not allowed. Pornography of any form, including partial nudity, is greatly frowned upon by community members. Discussion of other illegal materials, including but not limited to warez (illegal, non-licensed software products) on the channel is also prohibited.
6. Comparison between rA and other RO emulators are allowed, with moderation. No comparison, or discussion, in any aspect with regards to other implementations of Aegis, is not allowed. An exception is made for developers and bug-reporters discussing the behavior of Aegis in gameplay as compared to rAthena.
7. Excessive trolling = ban. Causing deliberate annoyance to channel users is greatly frowned upon, and violators of this rule will be seriously dealt with.
8. Do not abuse the channel bot commands (including spamming). Falls under "causing annoyance to other users".
9. No heavy nick changing/excessive channel hopping are allowed Falls under "causing annoyance to other users".
10. No impersonating members of rA forum admins/moderators/channel operators on the IRC server. One shall not impersonate (which means, pretend to be) any member of rAthena, especially the Administrators, Moderators, Support Leaders and Channel Operators.
11. Do not insult any other user in the channel. A rule of thumb: “Treat others as you want to be treated”. This means there is no toleration of calling people names, or otherwise playing \*god\* to them.

`12. Do not attempt to profit off rAthena through any possible means.`

This is in relation to rule \#1.

`13. Non-English chatting is allowed but should be kept to a minimum.`

Non-English usage is tolerable, however, it should be minimal. Most of the people who participate in the rAthena IRC channels are only English-speaking. Use the International Support Forums instead for rAthena support.

`Failure to abide by the rules will result in:`
`1. Being kicked out from the channel (for first and possibly second offence)`
`2. Temporary ban.`
`3. Permanent ban. (or possibly a network-wide ban)`
