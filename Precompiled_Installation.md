Pre-Compiled Versions
=====================

Using a pre-compiled version of [rAthena](/rAthena "wikilink") has its advantages. You don't have to worry about installing some dependencies on your system, such as a compile and Subversion. You also don't have to worry about going through the trouble of compiling the download, as it is ready almost out of the box.

The major disadvantage of using a precompiled version of rAthena is the customization is limited. Typically, the makers of such downloads will remove the /src/ folder in order to save space, and may remove some other files as well. This limits you on the emulator functionality, because the whole idea of open source is to customize the source code! If you have no intentions of modifying the code, then you may not need to worry about this.

Where to find Precompiled versions of rAthena
=============================================

Here are some places you can find precompiled versions of rAthena:

-   <http://rathena.org/board/files/category/46-svn-compilation-downloads/>
-   <http://sourceforge.net/projects/rathena/files/trunk/>

You can find precompiled versions for mostly [Windows](/wikipedia:Microsoft_Windows "wikilink"), but there are some [Linux](/wikipedia:Linux "wikilink") ones as well. They are sorted by revision number, with the latest revision number being at the top.

Using Precompiled versions
==========================

Basically, all you need to do is download the version of your choice and place it in a directory in which you will 'serve' rAthena. Follow the instructions in both the topic in which you downloaded the version, and the [connecting](/connecting "wikilink") and [configuration](/:Category:Configuration "wikilink") sections of the wiki.

Setup a [client](/:Category:Client_Configuration "wikilink") and you're all set to host and play.
