Description
-----------

@adjgroup is a command that temporarily changes a player/gm's group ID (eg. from 0 to GM level 90). It will not change the value of the SQL field of the target's group ID.

Usage
-----

-   **@adjgroup <character name> <level>**

Additional Notes
----------------

Due to the recent revisions of rAthena, the developers decided to change it from **@adjgmlvl** to **@adjgroup** in order to cope up with the database and create a much more specific account grouping.
