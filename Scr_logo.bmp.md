[frame|Default kRO screen-shot watermark.](/Image:scr_logo.png "wikilink")**scr_logo.bmp** is the branding/watermark image in the bottom-right corner in screen-shots taken inside the Ragnarok Online client, typically displaying the RO server's homepage address on official servers.

Customization
-------------

The file is stored in **data\\texture\\scr_logo.bmp** and can be either 8-bit or 24-bit bitmap. Magenta () colored areas will become transparent, when put on the screen-shot. Images with little or no gradients should be preferred, as the quality suffers from JPEG artifacts upon saving.
