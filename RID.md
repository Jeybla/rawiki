Most scripting commands and functions will want to request data about a character, store variables referenced to that character, send stuff to the client connected to that specific character. Whenever a script is invoked by a character, it is passed a so-called RID - this is the account ID number of a character that caused the code to execute by clicking on it, walking into it's [OnTouch](OnTouch) zone, or otherwise.

Usage
=====

When writing simple [NPCs](NPC) only, this topic will not require much attention. However, when using [functions](/Functions "wikilink"), [timers](/Timers_(Scripting) "wikilink"), or clock-based script activation, one requires to be aware of all cases when a script execution can be triggered without a RID attached. This will make a lot of commands and functions unusable, since they request data from a specific character, send data to a specific client, or store variables specific to a character, which are unavailable, if there's no RID, which refers to the character to work with, unless [attachrid](/attachrid "wikilink") is used to explicitly attach a character to the script first.

Whenever is stated *invoking character* or *currently attached character*, it actually means *the character whose RID is currently attached to the running script*. The script function [playerattached](playerattached) can be used to check which is the currently attached player to the script (it will return 0 if the there is no player attached or the attached player no longer is logged on to the map-server). The function [detachrid](/detachrid "wikilink") will explicitly set the RID to 0, so care must be taken, that follow-up commands do not depend on a character being attached, especially access to [temporary character variables](/Variables "wikilink").
