Syntax
------

-   petheal <level>,<delay>,<percent hp>,<percent sp>;

Description
-----------

petheal works the same as [petskillsupport](/petskillsupport "wikilink")' but has the skill ID hard-coded to 28 (Heal). **This command is deprecated**. It's not quite certain who's stats will be used for the skills cast, the character's or the pets. Probably, Skotlex can answer that question.

Examples
--------

**`petheal`**`,5,500,40,40;`
