[BuildBot](BuildBot) is a software development [continuous integration](/wikipedia:Continuous_integration "wikilink") tool which automates the [compile](/wikipedia:compiler "wikilink")/test cycle required to validate changes to the project code base. BuildBot is written in [Python](/wikipedia:Python_(programming_language) "wikilink") on top of the [Twisted](/wikipedia:Twisted_(software) "wikilink") libraries.

rAthena BuildBot
----------------

Developers *should* test their changes before committing. To help double-check each commit and also test compatibility on other operating systems, we have setup a [BuildBot](wikipedia:BuildBot).

<http://build.rathena.org/>

### BuildBot features

-   polls the SVN every 60 seconds for new changes to /
-   after a new commit, waits 2 minutes before triggering a build (if there is another commit within 2 minutes, the timer is reset)
-   compiles the servers, and checks for compile warnings/errors
-   starts map-server_sql, and checks for script/db warnings/errors
