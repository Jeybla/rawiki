What is import folder?
======================

The import folder is a way to input your settings into the emulator without changing any of the original settings that provide by emulator. As this directory is not overwritten when you perform an update for you local copy, you can keep all of your settings without worrying about conflicts.

Import folder available for for server configuration and for database files. The server will reads the original files first on and then the import files will be read after that. So, we recommended to place every your custom values on those import files.

Since import is implemented for files, *item_db2.txt*, *mob_db2.txt*, and *pet_db2.txt* are moved to .
