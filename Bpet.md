Syntax
------

-   [bpet](/bpet "wikilink");

Description
-----------

This command opens up a pet hatching window on the client connected to the invoking character. It is used in item script for the pet incubators and will let the player hatch an owned egg. If the character has no eggs, it will just open up an empty incubator window. This is still usable outside item scripts.
