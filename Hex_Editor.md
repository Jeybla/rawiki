A what?
=======

A **hex editor** (or *binary file editor* or *byte editor*) is a type of computer program that allows a user to manipulate the fundamental binary (0 / 1, zero / one) data that makes up computer files. Note that computer files can be very small (just a name, with no content) to very large (content spanning multiple hard disks). A typical computer file occupies multiple areas on the platter(s) of a disk drive, whose contents are put together to form the file. For more details see the [related Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor).
