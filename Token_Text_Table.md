permalink: /Token_Text_Table/
---

A text table format used for the [Ragnarok Online](Ragnarok_Online) client. It is used for organizing text data into columns and rows, mostly for id-description relations. It usually has the file extension **.txt** and can be found inside and outside the [GRF](/GRF "wikilink").

File Format
-----------

The files are plain text files, where rows and columns are separated by the token character [\#](wikipedia:Hash_symbol). It can be edited with every text editor like Notepad. Make sure, that the file is not stored in [Unicode](/wikipedia:Unicode "wikilink") or [UTF-8](/wikipedia:UTF-8 "wikilink").

The amount of columns is fixed for each file, that uses this file format. Rows are either limited by available memory or by hard-coded limits, as seen below. Note that all of these limits can be lifted by hexing the client. Whether line breaks are allowed within a cell or not depends on each file as well. Multi-line cells support using \# character inside the text, as long it is followed by a **space character**. Contrary to that, all other \# characters must be followed by either a new line or a non-spacing character.

### Comments

You may insert comments inside the file by putting **//** at the beginning of a line. The comment then spans to the end of that line. Trailing comments (not starting at beginning of a line) will not work. Example:

    row1#
    // Disabled because it does not work
    // row2#
    row3#
