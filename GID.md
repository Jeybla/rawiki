The **GID** stands for game id or game object id. It uniquely identifies each and every dynamic object ([NPC](/NPC "wikilink"), [monster](/mob "wikilink"), player, item, skill unit) inside the game. For the players a GID is their [account id](/AID "wikilink"), for all other objects it is a server-generated id, that changes each time the object is created.

You can view the id in-game by right-clicking on a object, when your account has enabled game master menu.
