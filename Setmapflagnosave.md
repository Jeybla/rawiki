Syntax
------

-   [setmapflagnosave](/setmapflagnosave "wikilink") "<map name>","<alternate map name>",<x>,<y>;

Description
-----------

This command sets the 'nosave' flag for the specified map and also gives an alternate respawn-upon-relogin point.

It does not make a map impossible to make a savepoint on as you would normally think, 'savepoint' will still work. It will, however, make the specified map kick the reconnecting players off to the alternate map given to the coordinates specified.
