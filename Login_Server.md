Login Server is where the users/players go right after pressing enter in the login screen of the client. During the process of logging in, username and password fields from the login table of the rAthena's schema will be compared with the username and password inputted by the client. Once verified, the player will proceed to the [Character Server‏‎](/Character_Server‏‎ "wikilink").
