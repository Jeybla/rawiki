Syntax
------

-   [delwaitingroom](/delwaitingroom "wikilink") {"&lt;NPC object name"};

Description
-----------

This command will delete a [waiting room](/waitingroom "wikilink"). If no parameter is given, it will delete a waiting room attached to the NPC object running this command, if it is, it will delete a waiting room owned by another NPC object. This is the only way to get rid of a waiting room, nothing else will cause it to disappear.

It's not clear what happens to a waiting room if the NPC is disabled with '[disablenpc](/disablenpc "wikilink")', by the way.
