This page describes how skill cooldowns (not delays) work.

### Overview

A skill cooldown is the time required before you can use this same skill again, in the game client a skill cooldown is identified by a cat pawn over the skill icon.

### Cooldown Persistency

Introduced in , cooldown persistency allows skills with long cool downs (for example Warlock's comet, with a 3 minute cooldown) not to be exploited by players with the use of going backwards to character selection screen and logging back in.

### Modifying

All skill cooldowns are stored in , its **cooldown** column defines how many *milliseconds* it's cooldown should last. ^_^
